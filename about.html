    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>This is Jaime and Abdu</p>

    <center><br>The Animal Translator<br><br></center>
    <div> Our hope for this product is that it helps to shorten the wide gap between humans and animals, allowing us to be able to
        take better care of them, and for them to be able to help further humanity and its causes even further.</div>
