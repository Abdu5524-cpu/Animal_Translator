# Landing-Page-Animal-Translator
Animal translator software landing page for software dev assignment. Jaime and I made a project selling a machine that helps talk to animals. We split it down the middle so he got the index file and I got the about file, we split the small requirements and did styling for our own pages. We then collaborated at the end for testing, code review, and submitting. I, Abdu, had troubles with keeping accurate records of the commits and which branch I'm committing from which is definitely a lesson to be learned. I tried to leave small notes to try and make it less confusing. Overall, Jaime did a great job divying up the workload and  split it 50/50 so the work load was split even and we both got to work on the various parts so we'd have a better idea.
